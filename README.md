# Cross-Cultural Technology Education Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis comparing technology education attitudes and acceptance between Irish and Indian students using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The study examines perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and attitudes toward STEM subjects across different cultural contexts.

## Research Focus

- Cross-cultural comparison of technology acceptance in education
- Gender bias analysis in technology perceptions
- TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) implementation
- STEM education preferences and career aspirations
- Technology access and digital divide assessment

## Key Findings

### Technology Acceptance Model Results
- **India**: Higher perceived usefulness (2.933 vs 2.103) - stronger STEM interest
- **Ireland**: Higher perceived ease of use (2.971 vs 2.278) - greater coding confidence
- **Attitude scores**: India (2.933) vs Ireland (2.103)

### Gender Bias Analysis
- **Ireland**: Minimal gender bias (1.4 points difference)
- **India**: Significant gender bias (7.2 points difference favoring boys)

### Technology Access
- **Smartphone access**: 100% in both countries
- **Computer access**: Ireland (87.9%), India (95.5%)
- **Internet access**: Ireland (90.9%), India (97.7%)

## Data Sources

The analysis is based on survey data from:
- 79 students (Ireland and India combined)
- 77 parents (Ireland and India combined)
- Multiple response formats across countries

## Technical Implementation

### Tools and Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Plotly for interactive visualizations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for statistical plots
- Scikit-learn for clustering analysis
- Scipy for statistical testing

### Key Features
- Automated data cleaning and validation
- Cross-cultural statistical comparisons
- Interactive visualizations
- Gender bias quantification
- TAM score calculations with effect size analysis

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Survey responses from students and parents in Ireland and India
2. **Data Processing**: Country-specific parsing due to different response formats
3. **Statistical Analysis**: TAM score calculations, correlation analysis, effect size computation
4. **Visualization**: Interactive charts showing cross-cultural comparisons
5. **Validation**: Robustness checks and error handling

## Usage

To run the analysis:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required Python packages
3. Open `WORK/v2.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
4. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis

## Key Insights

- Indian students show higher motivation toward technology but lower confidence
- Irish students demonstrate higher technical confidence but moderate interest
- Gender stereotypes are significantly stronger in Indian cultural context
- Both countries have excellent technology infrastructure foundation
- Programming language awareness varies, with Python being most recognized

## Applications

This research contributes to:
- Educational policy development for technology integration
- Gender equity initiatives in STEM education
- Cross-cultural educational program design
- Technology acceptance research methodology
- International collaboration in educational technology

## Data Privacy

All survey data has been anonymized and aggregated for analysis purposes. Individual responses are not identifiable in the dataset.
